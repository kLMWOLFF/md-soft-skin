**PRODUCT DESIGN**

**Context:**
- identity/values
- users
- physical environment (indoor/outdoor/home)
- competitors (who has similar projects/products) - what already exist

- budget
- material ressources (related to the values of the project + feasability)
- time available


**Information/idea of the context**
mind map w keywords and images references (moodboard) to go back to and guide the project development.

Find reference images that link to the project (shape/aesthetic,colors)

**Start sketching**
(paper/3D/collages)
- become physical as soon as possible [come out of head]
- help think about details/how it should be assemble
- test basic shapes/volumes
- work in real scale to understand 1:1 physicality
- how to manipulate the object
- express the concept


Test different scenarios w different users.

- vessel iterations, references (what is a bowl? - two hands/ceramic/sand/leaf) 
- what parts are important for you where you stand?
- different interpretation
- what is the most important part of the object?
- how can you scale it?
- how you can

    **Paper prototypes**
    - Filigree (move/change shapes/different pieces of paper puted together)
    - Weaving
    - Structures/mesh (pieces of paper assembled together) - gives another volume/appearence - patterns
    - Pleats (origami/repeating) - christophe Guberan (printing water patterns on paper to make it retract on specific places)
    - Narrative cut-outs (pop-up)
    - Playing with elements (air/water/earth/fire) - kites, Adrianus Kundert, Pinaffo Pluvinage (papier machine: conductive ink)
