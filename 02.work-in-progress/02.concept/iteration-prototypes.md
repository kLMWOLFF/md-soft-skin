# Iteration: Skin
 For developing the project concept, different possible iterations were sketched. Five of them were selected, and a new iterations drawn and prototyped from them.

### Rooting
 - What -
    What is it? What does it do?
 - Where -
    Where does it exist? Describe places in your home where you think you would like to keep the object and the reason why. Under what conditions is interaction taking place?
 - Who -
    For who is it?
 - How -
    How does it behave? How do people get the information they need? How do they interact with it? How does it communicate?
 - Why -
    Why does it exist? For what reasons is interaction taking place?

This rug robot has modular, fur-like straws that respond to footsteps. As someone stands on it, sensors detect pressure, causing the fur to tense and “grow” around their feet. The base modules heat up, creating a warm, comforting zone around each foot.

This robot blanket connects to your smartphone, adding a layer around you with each notification. As layers grow, it becomes harder to get out, until you’re fully enveloped in its folds, in a cozy cocoon.

This robot has a textured 3D surface that responds to touch. As the user strokes it, sensors detect the movement, expanding the surface in that area. When the hand moves, the texture follows it and the expanded spots return to their original form.
