# Iteration: Skin
 For helping in the development of the project concept, different iterations were sketched. From the iterations, the favorite ones were selected and turned into prototypes. In order to get better results, the process was repeated several times in loop, using the insights gathered from the last prototypes to generate new iterations.

### Concepts to work with
1. **Agency** - user's meaningful actions 
2. **Personality** - How it communicate (interaction/story)
3. **Feedback** - information that you provide to the user in result of their actions (haptic response/text/sound) 
    - Cybernetic Loop - constantly adjusting to each other (rithm/body gestures)
4. **Input/Output**


## **5Ws DESIGN** 
 
    - What -
    What is it? What does it do?

    - Where -
    Where does it exist? Describe places in your home where you think you would like to keep the object and the reason why. Under what conditions is interaction taking place?

    - Who -
    For who is it?

    - How -
    How does it behave? How do people get the information they need? How do they interact with it? How does it communicate?

    - Why -
    Why does it exist? For what reasons is interaction taking place?
