# md-soft-robotics: Skin
 During the first days of the module of Soft Robotics, it was defined that the choosen area of interest to perform the research in the subject would be the SKIN.
 
 ## **Wordstorm: Soft Robotics**

 **Insights:**
- Work with Symbiotic relationships
- What does a SOFT WORLD looks like?
- Build an Ecossystem of Interaction
- The SOFT is:
    - Always evolving (alive);
    - Flexible
    - Curved
    - Eatable 

1. What are the expectations around this robot?
2. Who will be interacting with it?
3. How will it change the interaction?

## **Dynamic: Card Draw** 
 Quick prototype ideas of possible robots, based on different combinations of words (Gesture /Soft characteristic /Relation /Sensor (Input) /Feedback (output) /Domestic behavior)

 **Robot01: Dumbo Tree**

Dumbo Tree is a robot tree that can be placed as decoration near a bed or couch. If it hears a person crying or making any kind of distressed sound, its leaves will reach down in a wriggling movement, and warp the person in a cocoon-like hug.

Secret Whisperer is a communication device to which one can tell secrets. The secret can be whispered in one extremity and its waves will travel to the other side, being encrypted and stored in a bubble.

### **Skin Mapping**

Series of macro photographs made from different parts of the same body.

**PATTERNS**

**EMOTIONS**

**Insights:**
- The skin has many different patterns and thicknesses depending on the part of the body it is
- Emotions are transmitted through the skin in the form of folds (SKIN LANGUAGE?)

### **Domestic Skins**

Series of photographs listing all kinds of skin creatures found inside the domestic space. After identifying them, the skins were classified in groups depending on their specific characteristics. This exercise also helped pinpointing some specific motions quite particular to skins.

 After listing all skin subspecies, some of them were choosen for a narration exercice, in which they were described as independent creatures.

**Insights:**
- Skins can appear in many forms, even as domestic objects;
- what defines an object as a skin can be:
    - its protection functionality
    - the kind of movement requested for interaction
    - comfort characteristic
    - multiple overlayerings
    - elasticity
