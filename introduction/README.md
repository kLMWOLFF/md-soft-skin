 MASTER MODULE IN SOFT ROBOTICS

 This is the repository with all the development process of the Master in Media Design module of Soft Robotics.
 
 ## **Briefing** 
 **Fluid Interactions:** Designing soft Robotics for Domestic Spaces.

    (In collaboration with CNRS, CEA, INRIA)

   ![alt text](readme-images/octopus.png)

   **Robots** -  increasingly integrated into our domestic lives

**Design** =  + flexible/sensitive/dynamic/adaptive/responsive (nature, organic systems, rhythms of life itself) 

**Terrestrial > Aquatic** - fluidity/adaptability of marine life

(Context = domestic lives)

Integrating new technologies **+** Familiar technologies or gestures 

(simplify complexity through poetics) 
</div>  



**Questions**
1. How to facilitate the transition to softer forms? 
2. How to create interactions aligned with the human body? 
3. How to develop elastic/deformable interactions (objects that pulse, vibrate, and respond to touch in organic ways)? 


 ## **Schedule:** 
 
 - 14th of October 2024 to 15th of January 2025
 
 - Mid-crit: 7th of November 2024

- Final jury: 15th of January 2025


## **Guidelines:** 
- Your soft robots must be interactive.
- Your design should address a specific usage within our domestic lives.
- Your prototype should demonstrate a simple yet poetic, playful, applied and novel interaction.
- Less is more. 
- Create an engaging experience.

## **Deliverables:** 
1. Presentation (research, goals, insights and methodology).
2. PDF detailing the key interactions of your object.
3. A Github “devlog” repository (simple notes, research, insights, code, and documentation).
4. 3D final (Fusion 360 file)
5. Mockup of your concept (paper).
6. Short movie showing your soft robots in action (max 1min)
