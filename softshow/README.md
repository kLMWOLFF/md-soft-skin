## **Brief** 
 **Title: ROOTING**

**Concept:** 
Root is a soft robot inspired by skin propreties and interactions that aims to ease people's anxiety by connecting them through touch to their imediate surroundings.

**Soft Robot for Anxiety Relief through Tactile Rooting**
 
 This soft robot, inspired by the properties found in different kinds of skins, is designed as a home companion for individuals experiencing anxiety, particularly those working in home office environments. It aims to help users “root” themselves in the present moment and connect with their immediate physical surroundings through touch-based interactions. Being anxiety an emotion linked to the anticipation of an imagined future, Root proposes a mediation linked to how a skin would perceive the imediate environment using feelings such as temperature, resistence, volume and friction.

 ## **Prototypes** 
  The prototypes were built based on word cards drawn from the keywords listed above. They were made in two different moments: the first group being a serie of fast prototypes ideas aiming to generate a broader understanding on the subject (using mostly two keywords for generating ideas); while the second group was build with the keywords more structured and the project idea already in mind (using random combinations of keywords from each specific category).
